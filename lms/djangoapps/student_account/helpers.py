    """Retrieve URLs for each enabled third-party auth provider.

    These URLs are used on the "sign up" and "sign in" buttons
    on the login/registration forms to allow users to begin
    authentication with a third-party provider.

    Optionally, we can redirect the user to an arbitrary
    url after auth completes successfully.  We use this
    to redirect the user to a page that required login,
    or to send users to the payment flow when enrolling
    in a course.

    Args:
        auth_entry (string): Either `pipeline.AUTH_ENTRY_LOGIN` or `pipeline.AUTH_ENTRY_REGISTER`

    Keyword Args:
        redirect_url (unicode): If provided, send users to this URL
            after they successfully authenticate.

        course_id (unicode): The ID of the course the user is enrolling in.
            We use this to send users to the track selection page
            if the course has a payment option.
            Note that `redirect_url` takes precedence over the redirect
            to the track selection page.

        email_opt_in (unicode): The user choice to opt in for organization wide emails. If set to 'true'
            (case insensitive), user will be opted into organization-wide email. All other values will
            be treated as False, and the user will be opted out of organization-wide email.

    Returns:
        dict mapping provider IDs to URLs
